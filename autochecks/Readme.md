# AlastriaID Autocheck Validation files (AlastriaID v.1.0)

To help the vendors with Wallet or Issuers&Service Providers commercial tools, the AlastriaID team has created a set of files for auto validation of the solution. 
With these two files, you can auto check your Wallet or Issuer or Service Provider solution to see how aligned your solution with the AlastriaID Model is.
After your auto-validation, you must take the correspondent excel auto check files and send to the team through a PR to validate.
